# Pyxis v2 rewrite

Big-bang ground-up rewrite. No v1 compatibility.

## Artifacts

- `plan.md` — the authoritative plan. Read it in full before working.

## Origin

Shaped through conversation on 2026-08-21. There is no upstream requirements document;
requirements and decisions were captured directly into `plan.md` sections
`Requirements` and `Decision Log`.

## Current position

**Milestone M2 is complete and live on the tailnet.** The live 386-entry legacy manifest is
fully accounted: 370 albums are in Discovery, 16 remain unresolved after manual review,
and no import request failed. The durable audit is
`docs/operations/2026-08-21-v1-album-import.md`.

Commit `18a5cce` is installed through `nix profile`. The `pyxis.service`,
`pyxis-tsnet.service`, and `pyxis-ytdlp-update.timer` user units are active. HTTPS, health,
system status, and the full 370-album library were verified through
`https://pyxis.hummingbird-lake.ts.net`.

The old system `pyxis.service` and `tsnet-proxy-pyxis.service` units are stopped. They
remain declared by the current NixOS generation and can return after a reboot or system
switch until the prepared `mountainous` removal is deployed.

Next: execute **M3 / U5**.

Execution order is the `Shipping Milestones` table in `plan.md`, not numeric U-ID order.
Per-unit progress comes from `git log`, not from this file.

Ship only at a milestone boundary.
